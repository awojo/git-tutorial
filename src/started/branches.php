			<h2>What is A Branch?</h2>
			<p>
				In GitHub a branch is where the content you create is stored within the repository. The main branch (also known as the default branch) is the first branch you will see when creating your repository.
				The special function branches have is the ability to make more branches from a branch to provide your own and other teammates personal code for projects.
			</p>
			<h2>The Branch Layout</h2> 
			<p>
				When you enter a Github project you will see the branches tab on the top of the screen.
				If you click on the dropdown menu, It will display three different sections for branches. The default branch sections provides the main branch mentioned earlier. The recent branches section
				displays the branches you viewed or edited recently. The third and final section shows other branches that are in your repository that does not fit within the two other sections. If needed you
				could always search for the name of a branch on the top search bar if you are working on similar branch names or a project that requires many branches. If you ever need to delete or rename a
				branch right click the one you want to modify.
