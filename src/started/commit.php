            <h1>Committing</h1>
			<p>
                One of the main building blocks when creating code on GitHub.
			</p>
			<h2>What are commits?</h2>
			<p>
				Commits are referred to as a record that shows the changes of the file. It is kinda like a save point in a way with a summary title and description to go along side the edit that was made from the code.
				Commits also provide who created the commit and the time a commit was created making up what is called the editing history (also called branch history) for the project. 
			</p>
			<h2>How Do I Make a Commit?</h2>
			<p> 
				To add a commit you first need to make a change to the project. This can be as simple as renaming a file to constructing an abundance of code as long as it is different from the original state the code was in.
				When you finish Github automatically requires you to create a commit explaining the overall process of what you did to the code. Once the commit is done you send it to the branch you used and it will be displayed on 
				the history tab.
