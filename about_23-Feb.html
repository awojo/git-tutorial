            <p>Andrew J. Wojciechowski, Noah J. Caballero, and Mary Allen are students at Western Michigan University, completing a course called Intro to Web Technologies. We were teamed up randomly, and each of us are pursuing different majors and degree programs.</p>

            <p>For our Web Technologies course, our Mid-term assignment was to create a website that demonstrated the HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills we had learned in the course thus far. Use of Git and GitHub were not required by our class, but we felt that Git would be the best tool for us to collaborate on our HTML and CSS code that would ultimately become our team website project.</p>

            <p>As we progressed with getting access to and learning to use Git and GitHub, we followed the help instructions available to us online, mainly at the Git and GitHub websites. We realized during this phase that a Git and GitHub tutorial from a studentâ€™s perspective may be useful to others; especially since one of our team members was very new to computer sciences and programming terminology.</p>

            <p>We hope that you will find this tutorial helpful for getting started with using Git and GitHub for your own projects.</p>
